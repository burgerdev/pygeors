Python Radius Search Module (Germany, at the moment)

Content
-------

This python module provides a few things related to geospatial information:

* a class **GeoLoc** representing geographic locations
* a function **query** that lets you search for locations
* a function **distance** that calculates the distance of two GeoLoc-objects
* a function **area** that returns all regions near a GeoLoc within a specified distance 
* an sqlite3 database of German communities with hierarchical and geospatial information (probably the most up-to-date database around)

This module does only work for **German** locations, but extensions are planned.
